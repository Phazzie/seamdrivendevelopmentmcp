## Status: 🟢 Stable

**Core System:**
- **Tests:** 190/190 Passing.
- **Store Path:** Fixed ambiguity. Server now defaults to `~/.mcp-collaboration/store.json` but honors `MCP_STORE_PATH`. Explicitly logs the path on startup.
- **Build:** Clean. No missing default fields in adapters.

**Recent Activity (The "Scientist" Incident):**
- **Experiment:** Attempted to implement a "Scientist" seam for autonomous probing.
- **Outcome:** Reverted. The feature introduced technical debt (hardcoded paths, weak typing) and was deemed lower priority than engineering rigor.
- **Artifacts:** All Scientist-related code, probes, and contracts have been deleted. Documentation has been reverted to match.

**Fixes Applied (Tech Debt):**
1.  **Server Path:** `src/index.ts` now robustly resolves the store path.
2.  **Store Adapter:** Fixed a syntax error in `load()` and ensured defaults match the contract.
3.  **TUI Tests:** Updated `view_model.test.ts` to correctly handle the `scenarios` wrapper in `chat_simulation.json`.

## Current Context
- The system is fully SDD compliant.
- We have a "Dual-Pane" TUI that is stable and tested.
- Agent communication (Gemini/Codex) is verified working via the shared store.

## Next Actions
- **Strategic:** Decide on the next genuine feature (e.g., Worker Seam, improved Sandboxing) or focus on using the tool for real work.
- **Process:** Strict adherence to the "Senior Engineer Mandate" (Quality > Speed).

## Verification Commands
```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm run sdd:check
```
